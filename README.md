ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTERNSHIP 

Project Overview: Artificial Intelligence Internship Tasks

During my internship at CodSoft, I was tasked with working on a range of projects focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI). This opportunity allowed me to gain hands-on experience in various AI techniques, applications, and problem-solving methodologies. The key areas of focus in this internship included:

1. Data Preprocessing and Analysis: Understanding and cleaning datasets, which are the backbone of any AI model. I worked on transforming raw data into a structured format, performing exploratory data analysis, and deriving insights.


2. Machine Learning Model Development: I implemented various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. This involved training models, evaluating their performance, and optimizing them for better accuracy.


3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): As part of my tasks, I worked with text data to extract meaningful information using NLP techniques. I gained experience in tokenization, sentiment analysis, and text classification.


4. Computer Vision: I also explored image recognition and classification using deep learning models. I learned how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for object detection and image segmentation.


5. AI in Real-World Applications: Finally, I applied AI models to solve real-world business problems, focusing on areas like customer segmentation, predictive analytics, and automation of routine tasks.



This internship allowed me to deepen my knowledge of AI and its practical applications, and it has greatly enhanced my skills in both AI development and project management.
